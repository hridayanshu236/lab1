# Linked List Implementation in C++

This C++ program implements a basic singly linked list data structure along with various operations such as adding nodes to the head or tail, removing nodes from the head or tail, searching for data, and retrieving data from a specified index.

## Overview

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in a sequence of nodes. Each node consists of two parts: data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. In a singly linked list, each node contains data and a pointer to the next node, forming a unidirectional chain.

## Features

- **Add to Head**: Adds a new node containing the specified data to the beginning of the list.
- **Add to Tail**: Adds a new node containing the specified data to the end of the list.
- **Remove from Head**: Removes the node at the beginning of the list.
- **Remove from Tail**: Removes the node at the end of the list.
- **Remove**: Removes the node containing the specified data from the list.
- **Search**: Searches for the specified data in the list.
- **Retrieve**: Retrieves the data at the specified index in the list.
- **AddAfter**: Adds node after a predecessor.
- **isEmpty**: Checks if the list is empty or not.
